    "The first and most important thing I'm going to emphasise here is that Google and Stack Overflow are a developers best friend - someone somewhere has had the same error as you and asked the question on Stack Overflow, if not you can be that someone somewhere. Always search for your questions or how to do something before spending 8 hours trying to debug - one of the main skills in development is the ability to search for your questions.\n",

    "[Python Basics for Data Science](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) - this is an intro to Python on Kaggle, which is a data science community that is definitely worth spending some time exploring. It has open source data sets, plenty of notebooks for all aspects of data science, and competitions/challenges. This course is ~5 hours and has it's own web-based compiler so no need for any installation. \n",
