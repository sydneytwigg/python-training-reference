    "## Basic computer operations\n",
    "Every algorithm and program is made up of a combination of the following building blocks:\n",
    "- Receive data\n",
    "    - read from a file\n",
    "    - read from an input device\n",
    "- Produce information\n",
    "    - write to a file or database\n",
    "    - output and display on screen\n",
    "- Perform arithmetic\n",
    "    - calculations can be performed on data\n",
    "- Assign value to variables\n",
    "    - give variables initial values\n",
    "    - assign values as a result of processing\n",
    "    - keep information for later use\n",
    "- Compare pieces of information and take action from the outcome\n",
    "    - conditional statements\n",
    "- Repeat a group of actions\n",
    "    - loops\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Analysing problems \n",
    "In order to create a script or a program you need to first understand what the problem you're trying to solve is, what result you're wanting and the steps to get that result. At a high level an algorithm can be divided into three main phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input - what data you have available to solve the problem\n",
    "2. Process - the steps taken to solve the problem\n",
    "3. Output - what the required results are\n",
