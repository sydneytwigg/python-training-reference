    "# Algorithm Design\n",
    "All software that is created - no matter the size and scope - go through a basic development cycle:\n",
    "![title](img/development_cycle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting out with learning to code, most people will brush over the designing phase and jump straight into writing code - while this will help you get used to the syntax and execution of the language it won't help to develop your skills in building the logical thinking behind how you code. The design phase of the development cycle is arguably the most important - it lays down the foundations for everything you will build in the future. If you're executing a poorly designed program you'll end up spending far longer going back and fixing it than if you'd spent the time to focus on logic and design initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something important to note is that there is no size limitation on this development cycle - this can be applied for a single function, a single script or an entire project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Design Steps\n",
    "At it's core, designing a program comes down to two steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Understand the task that you want to achieve.\n",
    "    - Understand fully and exactly what you're wanting to achieve with your code - what is the output that you're wanting to get from running the code and what do you have available to you to help with it? As a real world example, think of brushing your teeth and what exactly it is you need to do: walk to the bathroom and brush your teeth before bed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Determine the steps that must be taken to perform the task.\n",
    "    - Once you understand your task, you need to break down how to complete that task step by step. The steps should be sequential and logical, following the example of brushing your teeth we can break this down into high level steps:\n",
    "        1) Enter bathroom\n",
    "        2) Pick up toothbrush from holder\n",
    "        3) Pick up toothpaste\n",
    "        4) Remove toothpaste cap\n",
    "        5) Put toothpaste on toothbrush\n",
    "        6) Brush teeth\n",
    "        7) Rinse toothbrush\n",
    "        8) Rinse mouth\n",
    "        10) Place toothpaste cap back on\n",
    "        11) Place toothbrush back in holder\n",
    "        12) Leave bathroom\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If you were to brush your teeth before putting toothpaste on the toothbrush or attempt to begin brushing before entering the room, you wouldn't get the desired outcome. If you didn't put the toothbrush back in place or the toothpaste cap back on either you would run into issues if you tried to repeat the same steps again in the morning. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic computer operations\n",
    "Every algorithm and program is made up of a combination of the following building blocks:\n",
    "- Receive data\n",
    "    - read from a file\n",
    "    - read from an input device\n",
    "- Produce information\n",
    "    - write to a file or database\n",
    "    - output and display on screen\n",
    "- Perform arithmetic\n",
    "    - calculations can be performed on data\n",
    "- Assign value to variables\n",
    "    - give variables initial values\n",
    "    - assign values as a result of processing\n",
    "    - keep information for later use\n",
    "- Compare pieces of information and take action from the outcome\n",
    "    - conditional statements\n",
    "- Repeat a group of actions\n",
    "    - loops"

    "In order to create a script or a program you need to first understand what the problem you're trying to solve is, what result you're wanting and the steps to get that result. At a high level an algorithm can be divided into three main phases:\n",
